**Install brew**
``` 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
``` 

**Install rust**
``` 
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"            # For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
``` 

**Install wasm-pack**
```
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh
```

**Install some dependent libraries and software**
``` 
brew install ffmpeg            # Used to convert gif to ssf sequence frame files(.ssf)
brew install sdl2
brew install sdl2_image
brew install sdl2_gfx
brew install sdl2_ttf
brew install sdl2_mixer
``` 

Tips: Missing path in LIBRARY_PATH environment variable<br>
The Homebrew package manager symlinks library to the directory /usr/local/lib. <br>
To use these libraries with Rust, you need to add it to the LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. <br>
The command echo $LIBRARY_PATH will tell you if /usr/local/lib is added. <br>
If it is missing, add the following to the ~/.bash_profile configuration file:
```
export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib"
```
This will add the directory to the environment variable each time you start up a new Terminal window.


**Download RustPixel and deploy cargo-pixel**

Starting from version 0.5.3, you can deploy **cargo-pixel** directly from crates.io using `cargo install`.
```
cargo install rust_pixel         # use crates.io rust_pixel crate deploy cargo-pixel
cargo pixel                      # first run cargo-pixel will clone rust_pixel to <homedir>/rust_pixel_work automatic 
cd ~/rust_pixel_work             # cd to workspace
cargo pixel r petview s          # run demo game...
```

To use the newest code, you should clone **RustPixel** and deploy **cargo-pixel** tool:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/zipxing/rust_pixel
cd rust_pixel
cargo install --path . --force
```
