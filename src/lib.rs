//! RustPixel is a 2D game engine & rapid prototyping tools supporting both text and graphics rendering modes.
//! It is suitable for creating 2D pixel-style games and developing terminal applications.
//! it is also a perfect choice for developing and debugging CPU-heavy core algorithms
//! You can compile your core algorithms to ffi or wasm libs, and used by other gaming
//! frontend or backend
//!
//! Text Mode: Built with crossterm, runs in the terminal, and uses ASCII & Unicode Emoji for drawing.
//! Graphical Mode (SDL2): Built with SDL2, using PETSCII & custom graphics symbols for rendering.
//! Graphical Mode (Web): Similar to the SDL2 mode, but the core logic is compiled into WASM and 
//! rendered using WebGL and JavaScript (refer to rust-pixel/web-template/pixel.js).
//!
//! In RustPixel, game scenes are rendered using individual Cell and managed by Buffer
//!
//! Various modules asset, audio, event, game, log, render, algorithm, util are offered to ease
//! game development
//!
//! We also provide a base mode in which only algorithm, event and util modules are compiled.
//! Base mode requires fewer dependencies and therefore it is a good fit for compiling to ffi
//! or wasm libs.
